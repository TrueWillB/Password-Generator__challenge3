# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose

This is a simple password generator, written as a first introduction to the use of javascript. The user will enter a password length and what types of characters to include in the password, and then a password will be randomly generated. It should be noted that this password that is generated is not necessarily cryptographically secure, as it uses the Math.random method to generate the randomized letters. The ideal circumstance would be to use the Crypto.getRandomValues to generate more secure randomly generated passwords. PLEASE USE THIS GENERATOR AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Notes

- I added a feature that checks to make sure that at least 1 character of each type that the user specified is included in the generated password.
